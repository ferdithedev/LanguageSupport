# LanguageSupport

A spigot plugin to translate plugin messages into different languages. 
You can translate all plugin messages of plugins which allow editing the messages 
individually in as many languages as you want.

## Important!

- This plugin isn't using a translation API or something so you have to write each translation in every language manual!
- This plugin is still under development so it's possible that bugs may occur! Please report them in the issues section.

## How to use

### Setting up

You have to restart your server one time after you loaded the plugin the first time so less bugs can occur!
After that you will see that a few files were created: `players.yml, lsconfig.yml, de.yml, en.yml`
